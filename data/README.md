# Data

Files : 

* plane_based_Observations.xlsx --> observations
	Worksheet 1 : contains data obtained when measuring the height of two checkerboards (top and bottom)
	Worksheet 2 : contains height of one checker 
	Worksheet 3 : contains the data when the camera was tilted. this data was created to find that the distance given by camera is parallel to camera plane or not. 
	Worksheet 4 : nomral height measurement data
	Worksheet 5 and 6 :  contains data collected for distance measurement and variation of data in a specific block. From this we created the iterate function to reach to proper distance value over a given area.

	
* Recent_Observations.xlsx -->
	Updated version of plane_based_Observations. 
	Worksheet 1-5 are same. 
	Worksheet 6 : Contains the data for human distance measurement
	Worksheet 7 : contains data when the subject head was moving.

* record_15.pkl--> Contains recorded data of 15 frames. contains depth and color image.
